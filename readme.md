### 💬 About Me
Software Developer Engineer professional pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science and with 1.8 years of experience mainly in Full Stack Development. Experience in TypeScript, React, Next.js, Java, Spring Boot, RESTful API, Redux Toolkit and creating efficient systems.

During my tenure at Persistent Systems, I played a crucial role in developing a high-performance web application for a leading supply chain management company using React and JavaScript. I reduced initial load time by 38% (from 2.1s to 1.3s) through code splitting with Webpack and lazy loading, improving the Lighthouse performance score from 76 to 94. I enhanced state management efficiency by 30% using Context API and custom hooks, reduced invalid form submissions by 80% with React Hook Form and Zod, and integrated backend APIs using Axios. Collaborating with the UX team, I migrated from CSS Modules to Tailwind CSS, reducing bundle size by 40%. By optimizing application performance through useMemo and useCallback hooks, I achieved a 45% reduction in wasted renders and a 20% improvement in responsiveness.

As an intern at Persistent Systems, I developed and maintained scalable RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and Java. I implemented business logic, data access layers, and integrated Hibernate ORM for efficient database operations. I designed API endpoints, integrated MongoDB aggregation pipelines, and implemented authentication and authorization with Spring Security. I ensured code reliability through unit and integration testing with JUnit and Mockito, actively participated in Agile development, conducted code reviews, and maintained comprehensive documentation.

With a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, I thrive in creating efficient and scalable web applications that meet the demanding requirements of enterprise environments. Collaboration and teamwork are integral to my approach, as I believe in leveraging collective expertise to deliver exceptional results.
