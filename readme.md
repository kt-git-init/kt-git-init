### 💬 About Me
Software Developer Engineer pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science with 1.8 years of Full Stack Development experience. Skilled in TypeScript, React, Next.js, Java, Spring Boot, RESTful API, and Redux Toolkit, I focus on creating efficient systems.

At Persistent Systems, I developed a high-performance web app for a supply chain company using React and JavaScript, reducing load time by 38% and improving the Lighthouse score from 76 to 94. I enhanced state management efficiency by 30%, reduced invalid form submissions by 80%, and migrated from CSS Modules to Tailwind CSS, reducing bundle size by 40%.
