### 💬 About Me
Software Developer Engineer pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science with 1.8 years of Full Stack Development experience. Skilled in TypeScript, React, Next.js, Java, Spring Boot, RESTful API, and Redux Toolkit, I focus on creating efficient systems.

At Persistent Systems, I developed a high-performance web app for a supply chain company using React and JavaScript, reducing load time by 38% and improving the Lighthouse score from 76 to 94. I enhanced state management efficiency by 30%, reduced invalid form submissions by 80%, and migrated from CSS Modules to Tailwind CSS, reducing bundle size by 40%. I also optimized performance, cutting wasted renders by 45%.

As an intern at Persistent Systems, I developed scalable RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and Java, integrated Hibernate ORM, and implemented authentication and authorization with Spring Security. I ensured code reliability through unit and integration testing and participated in Agile development.

With a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, I excel in creating efficient, scalable web applications and value collaboration and teamwork to deliver exceptional results.
